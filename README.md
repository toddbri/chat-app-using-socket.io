## What It Is
An application that allows multiple users to chat simultaneously using a browser.


## Languages used
* Socket.io
* Node.js
* jQuery
* CSS
* HTML

## Overview
The application allows each user to choose a username upon sign in. It then assigns each user a color
that is used to display their messages in the chat window. The application alerts all users when someone
is typing a message. A list of all current users is shown on the right. It also announces when a user
enters or leaves the chat room.
